    q: "What makes your approach different from other dietitians?",
    a: "With 25+ years of clinical experience including my role as Area Technical Head at VLCC managing 25+ centers, I focus on sustainable, real Indian food that your family already eats. No unrealistic diets, imported superfoods, or crash plans. Just practical, evidence-based, measurable results with food you love. I also provide ongoing WhatsApp support and coordinate with your cook or family for seamless implementation.",

    q: "How long does it take to see results?",
    a: "Most clients see improvements within 2-4 weeks - better energy levels, reduced bloating, improved blood parameters.

    q: "How do you coordinate with my existing doctors?",
    a: "I work collaboratively with your physicians, especially for conditions like diabetes and cardiac care.

Many of my clients see medication reductions as their health improves (always under medical supervision).",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help with family meal planning?",

I provide practical solutions that make Indian family cooking healthier without cooking separate meals.",
